Make a *COPY* of dbconnection.example.php
with the name of "dbconnection.php"
and edit it. Make a copy and leave the original file at it's place.

Same about localize.example.php
COPY it as "localize.php" and edit it.
Leave the "localize.example.php" as is, without overriding or deleting it.

thanks :)
